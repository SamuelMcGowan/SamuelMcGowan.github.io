# Welcome to Squoop.info!

<hr>
I'm Sam McGowan. I'm an 19-year-old from the UK. Welcome to my website!

[Check out my latest posts!](/posts.html){: .fancy-button .unstyled-link}

## Music

I make Drum and Bass, House and other kinds of electronic music in Bitwig Studio. I post what Iâ€™m working on on TikTok as [@squooop](https://tiktok.com/@squooop) - give me a follow!

I also sometimes post tracks [on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/illuctant).

## Instagram

{% include instagram_widget.html %}

## GitHub

```python
def make_website(a, b):
    site = make_empty_repository()
    try:
        web.design()
    except:
        raise SkillNotFoundError()
    try:
        site.add_content()
    except:
        raise WritersBlock()
    return site
```

My GitHub is [here](https://github.com/SamuelMcGowan). It's mainly Rust and theming stuff.

## Scratch

Come and watch me flex my block-based programming skills [on Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/squoop/).
