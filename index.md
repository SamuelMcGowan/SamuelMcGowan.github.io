# Welcome to my Homepage!

I'm Sam (18m), I make music and do programming, among other things.

To be honest, I don't have that much to put here at the moment, but hopefully that will change at some point.

```python
def make_website(a, b):
    site = make_empty_repository()
    try:
        site.design()
    except:
        raise SkillNotFoundError()
    try:
        site.add_content()
    except:
        raise WritersBlock()
    return site
```
