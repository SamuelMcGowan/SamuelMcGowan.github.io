# Links to some of my stuff
- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/sam-mcgowan-music): I made most of this music a while ago. I'm currently making a lot of House and DnB, but I can't upload it because [PopOS](https://pop.system76.com/) can't handle [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/) in Wine so I'm using the demo version of [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/).
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/differently.artistic/): I post photos here occasionally :D
- [GitHub](https://github.com/SamuelMcGowan): Pretty barren here, but I suppose it's still worth putting the link here.
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/squoop/): I spend too much time here.
