# I made a font! (5 months ago)

It's a bitmap font that I made using [an online tool](https://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/), but I'm still pretty pleased with it. It's monospace and has glyphs for all the characters available in the font editor.

If you want to try it, you can download it from [the Github repo](https://github.com/SamuelMcGowan/vanilla-mono).
